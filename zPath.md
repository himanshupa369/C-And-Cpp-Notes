# 1-Year Integrated Roadmap

**Junior Software Engineer → Software Engineer**

## Core Principles of This Roadmap

* **Do not overload any quarter**
* **Technical depth first**, breadth later
* Certifications are grouped by **career signal**, not popularity
* English + PM skills are used to **unlock visibility and leadership**

---

## Quarter 1 (Months 1–3): Foundation & Communication

### Primary Objective

Become a **reliable, articulate engineer** with solid C++ fundamentals.

### Certifications / Courses

### 1. **CPA – C++ Certified Associate**

**Priority:** Very High
**Why here:**

* Establishes strong C++ baseline
* Improves confidence in reviews and debugging
* Signals seriousness about your core skill

---

### 2. **Professional English Certification**

Examples:

* British Council – Professional English
* Coursera: Improving Communication Skills
* LinkedIn Learning: Business Communication for Engineers

**Priority:** High
**Why here:**

* Promotion is blocked more often by **communication gaps** than coding gaps
* Helps in standups, reviews, emails, demos

---

### 3. **Agile Project Management Micro-Course**

**Priority:** High
**Why here:**

* Immediate benefit in sprint planning
* Helps you estimate, negotiate scope, and ask better questions

---

### On-the-Job Focus

* Deliver tasks **on time, with tests**
* Ask *why*, not just *what*
* Start writing small design notes

---

## Quarter 2 (Months 4–6): Ownership & Delivery Mindset

### Primary Objective

Transition from “task executor” to **feature owner**.

### Certifications / Courses

### 4. **Google Project Management – Foundations**

**Priority:** Medium–High
**Why here:**

* Teaches scope, risk, dependencies
* Helps you think like a Software Engineer, not a junior

---

### 5. **Start CPP – C++ Certified Professional**

(Preparation phase)
**Priority:** Very High
**Why here:**

* CPP is your **strongest technical promotion signal**
* Requires time—start early

---

### On-the-Job Focus

* Own a small feature end-to-end
* Refactor or optimize existing C++ code
* Start mentoring informally

---

## Quarter 3 (Months 7–9): Industry Readiness & Cloud Awareness

### Primary Objective

Become **cloud-literate and cross-functional**.

### Certifications / Courses

### 6. **Complete CPP – C++ Certified Professional**

**Priority:** Very High
**Why:**

* Separates you from most junior engineers
* Demonstrates depth, not just experience

---

### 7. **AZ-900 – Microsoft Azure Fundamentals**

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:**

* Cloud literacy
* Helps you understand deployment, scaling, cost
* Useful in enterprise discussions

---

### 8. **AI-900 – Azure AI Practitioner**

**Priority:** Low–Medium
**Why here (and not earlier):**

* Conceptual understanding only
* Useful for AI-integrated products
* Not core to C++, so keep lightweight

---

### On-the-Job Focus

* Participate in design discussions
* Understand how your service is deployed
* Improve non-functional aspects (logging, performance)

---

## Quarter 4 (Months 10–12): Senior Signals & Promotion Positioning

### Primary Objective

Demonstrate **engineering maturity and security awareness**.

### Certifications / Courses

### 9. **DevOps Basics (CI/CD, Containers)**

**Priority:** Medium

* Helps you support releases
* Improves collaboration with DevOps/SRE

---

### 10. **AWS Certified Developer – Associate**

**Priority:** Medium–High
**Why:**

* Practical cloud development skills
* Strong industry recognition
* Complements AZ-900 well

---

### 11. **Google Professional Cloud Developer**

**Priority:** Medium
**Why last:**

* Advanced and time-consuming
* Best done after AWS concepts are clear
* Signals multi-cloud capability

---

### 12. **CSSLP – Secure Software Lifecycle Professional**

**Priority:** Medium
**Why here:**

* Security awareness is a **senior-engineer trait**
* Extremely strong for promotion discussions
* Do not rush this—understand SDLC first

---

### On-the-Job Focus

* Own a medium-sized subsystem
* Reduce bugs or incidents
* Write design docs

## Final Certification Timeline Summary

| Quarter | Certifications                                        |

## Important Reality Check (Very Important)

Doing **all** of these certifications is **only valuable if**:

* You apply them at work
* You increase ownership
* Your manager sees growth in **impact, not certificates**

If workload becomes heavy:
**Never sacrifice CPP, English, or delivery quality.**

## Strong Promotion Narrative You Can Use

> “Over the last year, I’ve deepened my C++ expertise, improved my communication, learned how projects are planned and delivered, and gained cloud and security awareness. I’m now able to own features end-to-end and support releases confidently.”

That is a **Software Engineer**, not a junior.
